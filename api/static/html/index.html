    <h1>API Routes</h1>
    <p class="par">
      Welcome to the API for my capstone project. The project I am building is
      an e-commerce website with a points system, where users are also allowed
      to sell products. The points system operates in a way that the more points
      a user accumulates, the higher their rank becomes. As they ascend through
      the ranks, they gain access to discounts and deals. Please see the routes
      provided by this API below:
